By default, the math is a little bit too big (a little larger than surrounding text) - at least on the default Asciidoc theme. As such, the default is 90%%. Default: 90%%.",

Fortunately, Mathjax provides a "style" attribute in the svg (in the form of CSS), which is normally used by browsers to vertically align the math characters. I figured out a way to read this, process it, and achieve a similar effect in pdfs. The idea is that for simple symbols, like $x$, you usually want to position it. However, when you have a fraction ($\frac{a}{b}$), it usually looks better unpositioned. This option controls the default positioning for cells. Default: position.',
